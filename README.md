# Commit Conventions

The following commit conventions are used:

- feat: For new features.
- fix: For bug fixes.
- docs: For changes in documentation.
- style: For changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, etc.).
- refactor: For code changes that neither fix errors nor add functionalities.
- test: For adding or modifying tests.
- chore: For project maintenance tasks.

Each commit should start with one of these keywords, followed by a brief imperative present tense message describing the change made. For example:
